1,Leaving the EU would significantly decrease foreign direct investment into the UK.,Yes,Yes (10),,Yes (10),,,,NA,,NA,,,,,"""Concerns about a drying up of foreign direct investment if Britain votes to leave the European Union are somewhat overblown...It is likely Britain would remain a haven for foreign direct investment flows even if it was outside of the European Union. Of course, we could see a period of weak foreign direct investment inflows as the United Kingdom’s new relationship is renegotiated. However, if Britain is able to obtain favourable terms, then foreign direct investment would probably recoup this lost ground.""

https://woodfordfunds.com/economic-impact-brexit-report/",,"""Brexit would make the UK less attractive for FDI. If access to the Single Market was lost, lower
FDI inflows would seem unavoidable, reducing the inflows of new ideas and knowledge into the UK. This
would weaken fixed investment, reduce export capacity and hit innovation and productivity (technical
progress) over time.""  https://www.oecd.org/eco/The-Economic-consequences-of-Brexit-27-april-2016.pdf","""Trade and investment  ows would be lower."" - https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517415/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_web.pdf ",,

2,The annual contribution to the EU budget is a good investment.,Yes,,,Yes (10),,,,NA,,NA,,,,,"The government may choose to use the £10bn savings from its contributions to the European Union budget to compensate the hardest hit sectors (including some manufacturing industries) and regions, at least in the short term. The extra costs which British exporters would pay in higher tariffs would be less than the savings the United Kingdom would make on its contributions to the European Union – making it feasible for the government to compensate the losers from Brexit, at least in the short term.https://woodfordfunds.com/economic-impact-brexit-report/","While the mechanical event of Brexit would strengthen the UK's finances, this would likely be offset by reductions in GDP. As a result, the overall effect of Brexit would damage the UK's public finances and require an additional one or two years of austerity to balance the budget.","""Fiscal savings from stopping net transfers to the EU budget are likely to be 0.3-0.4% of GDP per
year, which is a relatively small amount...Thus there appears little
scope to use the EU budget savings to relax fiscal policy substantially for an extended period, unless there
is a decision to adjust other taxes and spending, or to raise the size of the overall budget deficit."" https://www.oecd.org/eco/The-Economic-consequences-of-Brexit-27-april-2016.pdf","""The negative impact on GDP would also result in substantially weaker tax receipts. This would signi cantly outweigh any potential gain from reduced  nancial contributions to the EU. The result would be higher government borrowing and debt, large tax rises or major cuts in public spending. After 15 years, even with savings from reduced contributions to the EU, receipts would be £20 billion a year lower in the central estimate of the EEA, £36 billion a year lower for the negotiated bilateral agreement and £45 billion a year lower for the WTO alternative. £36 billion is more than a third of the NHS budget and the equivalent of 8p on the basic rate of income tax."" - https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/517415/treasury_analysis_economic_impact_of_eu_membership_web.pdf",,

3,Leaving the EU would significantly increase unemployment levels in the UK.,Yes,,,NA,,Yes,,NA,,NA,,,,,"""Fears over the threat of Brexit to trade and resultant employment are often overdone, with some pretty big figures being bandied around regarding the potential loss to the British economy. The most striking – and most inaccurate – is that 3 to 4 million jobs, i.e. the number of people employed in exporting goods and services to the European Union, could be lost through Brexit. Given that this assumes that all exports to the Union would cease if the United Kingdom was to leave, it is a wild overstatement...

pressure on house prices, which reduces affordability for first-time buyers. However, the UK faces a longstanding
